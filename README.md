# NYC-DEMAND-PREDICTION

## SUMMARY :-

New York City (NYC) is one of the busiest cities in the world, if not the busiest. It has lots of tourist attractions and office buildings. It creates a significant requirement for taxi services. It has more than 13000 licensed cabs. Using multiple time-series methods, we can forecast the areas where there is a need for taxis during certain time intervals. Time-series forecasting is one of the hot research topics in data science. Various models and approaches have been tested from statistical methods to deep neural networks. Machine learning enthusiasts tend to jump directly to machine learning models when it comes to time series prediction avoiding statistical methods which, in a lot of cases, have shown better performance across both accuracy measures and for all forecasting horizons. 
Taxi demand prediction has become extremely important for taxi-hailing (and e-haling) companies as a way to understand their demand and optimize their fleet management. The model will try to forecast the demand for yellow taxis in the chosen time interval.
