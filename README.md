# NYC-DEMAND-PREDICTION

## SUMMARY :-

New York City (NYC) is one of the busiest cities in the world, if not the busiest. It has lots of tourist attractions and office buildings. It creates a significant requirement for taxi services. It has more than 13000 licensed cabs. These are the famous NYC yellow taxis that provide transportation exclusively through street-hails. The number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. People can access this mode of transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with their hand.Through our project, we aim to forecast the taxi demand in specific areas during certain time intervals. Time-series forecasting is one of the hot research topics in data science. Various models and approaches have been developed from statistical methods to deep neural networks. Machine learning enthusiasts tend to jump directly to machine learning models when it comes to time series prediction avoiding statistical methods which, in a lot of cases, have shown better performance across both accuracy measures and for all forecasting horizons.
